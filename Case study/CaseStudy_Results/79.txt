 Pattern ID :79
Pattern Name: (Warning_E_Anony.Audit)(2)(Path) between task writes data to Auditiability dataObject and task sends messages over Anonymity(AI) messageFlow.bpmnq
To determine if there is a conflict, we must analyze the conflict pattern and the model, comparing security artifacts and their associations to tasks or message flows. Here's the detailed breakdown and analysis:

### Parsing the Conflict Pattern and Model:
1. **Conflict Pattern Security Artifacts:**
    - **Anonymity**:
        - `id="Anonymity_2"`
        - `anonymityLevel="Anonymous"`
        - `insiderAdversary="true"`

    - **Auditability**:
        - `id="Auditability_1"`

2. **Conflict Pattern Associations:**
    - Message Flow security:
        - Anonymity artifact `Anonymity_2` is linked to `MessageFlow_1`.
    - `MessageFlow_1` is:
        - From `Task_2` to an unspecified participant.

    - Data Output security:
        - Auditability artifact `Auditability_1` associated with `DataObject_2`.
    - `DataObject_2` is:
        - Written by `Task_1`.

3. **Model Security Artifacts:**
    - **Anonymity**:
        - `id="Anonymity_3"`
        - `anonymityLevel="Anonymous"`
        - `insiderAdversary="true"`

    - **Accountability**, **Confidentiality**, etc., present but irrelevant for the exact match criteria in the conflict pattern.

4. **Model Associations:**
    - Message Flow security:
        - Anonymity artifact `Anonymity_3` linked to `Task_2` pointing to `MessageFlow_6`.
    - Data Output security:
        - Not directly annotated with an `Auditability` artifact as in conflict pattern.

### Conflict Detection:
- **Anonymity Match**: In the model, `Anonymity_3` matches with `Anonymity_2` in the conflict pattern with `anonymityLevel` and `insiderAdversary`.
- **Auditability Missing**: No direct match for the `Auditability` artifact association with data objects in the model as in conflict pattern.

### Conclusion:
- **No Conflict Detected**: 
  - There is **no match** for the `Auditability` artifact directly associated with a data object in the model as in the conflict pattern.
  - Without a complete match of all required conflict pattern security artifacts, including the operation type ('WRITE'), there is no conflict.

### Resolution Suggestion:
Since no conflict is detected, there's no resolution needed. However, maintaining clarity and consistency in artifact naming conventions and security configurations is advisable to prevent actual conflicts.

```json
{
    "Conflict Pattern Name": "Warning_E_Anony.Audit)(2)(Path) between task writes data to Auditiability dataObject and task sends messages over Anonymity(AI) messageFlow.bpmnq",
    "conflcit Detection": false,
    "Explanation of Conflict": "There is no conflict detected since the required security artifacts and associations outlined in the conflict pattern do not fully match those in the model. Particularly, the Auditability artifact is not present in the model as required.",
    "Summarise Explanation of Conflcit": "No complete artifact match in model to conflict pattern, thus no conflict.",
    "Resolution Suggestion": "Maintain clarity in artifact naming and configurations to prevent potential conflicts."
