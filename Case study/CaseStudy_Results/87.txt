 Pattern ID :87
Pattern Name: (Warning_E_Unobserv.Authent)(2)(Path) between task writes data to Authenticity dataObject and task sends messages over Unobservability messageFlow.bpmnq
To determine if there is a conflict between the conflict pattern and the model, let's perform a detailed analysis based on the provided XML content:

### 1. Parsing and Analyzing the Conflict Pattern

- **Message Flow**: The conflict pattern contains a `<bpmn2:messageFlow>`:
  - `MessageFlow_1` with `sourceRef="Task_2"` and `targetRef="Participant_2"`.

- **Security Artifacts**:
  - Unobservability (`Unobservability_1`), associated with `MessageFlow_1`, via `SecurityAssociation_1`.

- **Tasks**:
  - `Task_1` with associated data output operations on `DataObject_2`:
    - Authenticity (`Authenticity_1`) is linked to `DataObject_2` via `SecurityAssociation_2`.

### 2. Parsing and Analyzing the Model

- **Message Flows**:
  - `MessageFlow_1` in the model is associated with several security artifacts, including Unobservability (`Unobservability_2`).

- **Tasks**:
  - `Task_2` named "Send data to portal" is relevant for `MessageFlow_6` (since `MessageFlow_1` is relating to `IntermediateCatchEvent_2`).
  - `Task_6` named "Update the EHR" writes to `DataObject_2`:
    - No direct mention of Authenticity like in the conflict pattern.

### 3. Conflict Detection Criteria Analysis

- **Matching Security Artifacts**:
  - The conflict pattern has Unobservability associated with a message flow. This is found in the model with `MessageFlow_1` linked via `SecurityAssociation_12`.

- **Writing to Data Object**:
  - In the conflict pattern, `Task_1` specifically writes to `DataObject_2` with Authenticity. In the model, there is no such corresponding operation with Authenticity, hence no direct mapping for Authenticity.

### Conclusion

The model does not exhibit a conflict against the specified conflict pattern because:

1. The **Authenticity** security artifact required in the conflict pattern is not directly linked to any write operation to a data object in the model.
2. The any anonymity properties like anonymityLevel="Anonymous" and insiderAdversary="true", are not directly required or specified in the conflict pattern elements as criteria for conflict in this particular case. Thus, the mentioned properties do not invoke a direct conflict in the case at hand due to the absence of Authenticity.
2. **Unobservability** is successfully matched in `MessageFlow_1`, but it does not cover the requirement gap regarding `Authenticity`.

### Resolution Suggestion

Since the conflict is not detected due to the missing linkage of Authenticity in the model's operation to data objects, to ensure comprehensive security requirements:

- **Authentication Validation**: Clarify if later iterations of model should implement Authenticity checks or align security needs without conflicting operations.
- **Clear Security Path**: Document or clarify intended security associations clearly, ensuring model operations align with pattern expectations.
