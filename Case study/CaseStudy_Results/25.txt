 Pattern ID :25
Pattern Name: (Error_D_Anony.NonDel) Non-Delegation-annotated task sends messages over an Anonymity(Anonymous,Insider)-annotated messageFlow.bpmnq
To determine whether a conflict is detected based on the provided criteria, let's analyze both the Conflict Pattern and the Model.

1. **Conflict Pattern Analysis**:
   - **Task**: `Task_1` (id: Task_1) in Process 2, annotated with a `nonDelegation` security artifact.
   - **Message Flow**: `MessageFlow_1` in Collaboration 1, annotated with an `anonymity` (level="Anonymous", insiderAdversary="true") security artifact.

2. **Model Analysis**:
   - **Task Matches**: `Task_1` (id: Task_1) named "Measure vital signs" in Process 2, associated with multiple security artifacts, but no match for `nonDelegation`.
   - **Message Flow Matches**:
     - `MessageFlow_1` used by "Submit evaluation" task (id: Task_11), has `nonRepudiation`, `unobservability`, `confidentiality`.
     - There is no exact match for the security artifact `anonymity` with properties (level="Anonymous", insiderAdversary="true"), on any messageFlow or event in the same context.

**Conflict Detection**:
- **Comparison**:
  - We need to find a match where the Model reproduces the whole set of conditions present in the Conflict Pattern. For the detection of conflict in this specific pattern:
    - **Task Conflict**: No `nonDelegation` artifact associated with `Task_1` in the Model.
    - **Message Flow Conflict**: No anonymity artifact with properties "Anonymous" and "Insider Adversary" found on corresponding message flows or tasks linked in the same pattern.

**Conclusion**: 
- Since the task `Task_1` lacks the `nonDelegation` artifact present in the conflict pattern, and the message flows don't match the specified anonymity properties altogether, no conflict is detected according to the given rules.

**Resolution Suggestion**:
- Since no conflict is reported based on the criteria, no resolution action is necessary. Nonetheless, ensuring a complete mapping and consistency of artifact properties between use case specifications and conflict patterns is vital for future assessments.

{
    "Conflict Pattern Name": "(Error_D_Anony.NonDel) Non-Delegation-annotated task sends messages over an Anonymity(Anonymous,Insider)-annotated messageFlow.bpmnq",
    "conflict Detection": false,
    "Explanation of Conflict": "No conflict detected as the specific non-delegation artifact on Task 1 and the required anonymity properties on a message flow do not match between the pattern and the model.",
    "Summarise Explanation of Conflict": "The non-delegation and anonymity properties do not align as required by the conflict pattern.",
    "Resolution Suggestion": "Ensure model tasks and flows align with all specifications needed for security artifacts to avoid potential future conflicts."
