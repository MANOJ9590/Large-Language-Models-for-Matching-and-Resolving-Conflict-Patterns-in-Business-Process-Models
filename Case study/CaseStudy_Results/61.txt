 Pattern ID :61
Pattern Name: (Warning_C_Anony.NonRep) (Path) between a task sends messages via a NonrepudationmessageFlow and a task sends messages via an Anonymity(AI)messageFlow.bpmnq
To determine if a conflict is detected, let's analyze both the conflict pattern and the model based on the criteria provided:

1. **Conflict Pattern Analysis:**
   - Two message flows:
     - `MessageFlow_1` is associated with an Anonymity artifact (`Anonymity_2`) with anonymityLevel "Anonymous" and insiderAdversary "true".
     - `MessageFlow_2` is associated with a Nonrepudiation artifact (`NonRepudiation_1`).

2. **Model Analysis:**
   - Message flows:
     - `MessageFlow_6` associated with "Undetectability", "Confidentiality", and "Accountability".
     - `MessageFlow_1` associated with a Nonrepudiation artifact (`NonRepudiation_1`).

3. **Comparison:**
   - We need to find a match in the model where:
     - One message flow is secured by Nonrepudiation.
     - Another message flow is secured by Anonymity with properties anonymityLevel "Anonymous" and insiderAdversary "true".

The conflict pattern requires the presence of a message flow with the Anonymity artifact (with specified properties) and a separate message flow with Nonrepudiation.

4. **Detected Conflict:**
   - The model contains a message flow (`MessageFlow_1`) with Nonrepudiation attached, which matches part of the conflict pattern.
   - However, there is no message flow in the model that has the Anonymity (with the required specific properties: anonymityLevel "Anonymous" and insiderAdversary "true") linked to it. Instead, an Anonymity artifact (`Anonymity_1`) is found linked to a data association, not a message flow.

**Conclusion:**
- **Conflict Detection: Boolean:** `false`
- **Explanation of Conflict:** There is no conflict detected because although a Nonrepudiation artifact matches the pattern requirement on a message flow in the model, no Anonymity artifact with the exact properties identified in the conflict pattern is attached to a message flow in the model.
- **Summarize Explanation of Conflict:** No match for anonymity on message flows found; hence, no conflict.
- **Resolution Suggestion:** Since no conflict is detected, no resolution is needed.
