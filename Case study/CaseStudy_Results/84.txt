 Pattern ID :84
Pattern Name: (Warning_E_Unobserv.Audit)(1)(Path) between task reads data from Auditiability dataObject and task sends messages over Unobservability messageFlow.bpmnq
To determine if there is a conflict, let's systematically evaluate the provided models against the defined conflict pattern.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Parsing the XML Contents**:
   - **Conflict Pattern**:
     - **Tasks and Message Flows**:
       - Task in Process `@Y Process`: 
         - `Task_1` named `@A` reads from `DataObject_2` named `@B`.
         - `Task_2` named `@C` sends messages over `MessageFlow_1`.
     - **Security Artifacts**:
       - `Unobservability_1` linked via `SecurityAssociation_1` to `MessageFlow_1`.
       - `Auditability_2` linked via `SecurityAssociation_3` to `DataObject_2`.

   - **Model**:
     - **Tasks and Message Flows**:
       - Task in Process `Tele-medicine Device Process`:
         - `Task_2` named `Send data to portal` sends messages over `MessageFlow_6`.
     - **Security Artifacts**:
       - `Unobservability_2` linked via `SecurityAssociation_12` to `MessageFlow_1`.
       - `Auditability` is not explicitly defined in tested components, but there is `Accountability_1` linked via `SecurityAssociation_8` to `Task_2`.

2. **Conflict Detection Criteria**:
   - The conflict pattern requires both `Auditability` on a data read and `Unobservability` on a message flow involving the same tasks/data objects.
   - **Operations Classification**:
     - Read (`READ`) from `Auditability` data object should exist in both the pattern and the model.
     - The pattern expects a send (`WRITE`) with `Unobservability`.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The model includes an unobservability check linked to `MessageFlow_1`. However, the model contains `MessageFlow_6` with Unobservability.
   - The pattern task `Task_2` corresponds somewhat in function to `Task_2` in the model which transfers data, but the linking element primarily points to `MessageFlow_1`.
   - There is no exact mapping for `Auditability` being applied as required by the pattern in the model.

### Conclusion of Conflict Detection
- **Conflict Detected**: **False**.
- The model does not integrate all the security artifacts as specified in the conflict pattern due to the missing link of `Auditability` requirements on operations mirroring the pattern. The model lacks a suitable exact element such as an artifact implementing `Auditability` that applies to a task linked to an analogous message flow with `Unobservability`.

### Explanation
- **Conflict Explanation**:
  - The conflict pattern expects both `Auditability` and `Unobservability` in specific contexts. Specifically, the data linked under `Auditability` read context should engage with tasks bound to message flows marked by `Unobservability`.
  - In the given model, despite Unobservability, the specific triggered linkage (read on data before sending) via `Auditability` isn't established.

### Resolution Suggestion
- **Resolution**:
  - Ensure that a task explicitly reads from a data object linked with `Auditability`, coupled precisely with a following message flow marked by `Unobservability`. Modify associations whereby the data operation under `Auditability` marking reaches full compliance with the expected transition flow triggering said pattern.

```json
{
  "Conflict Pattern Name": "Warning_E_Unobserv.Audit",
  "Conflict Detection": false,
  "Explanation of Conflict": "The conflict pattern requires both Auditability on a read data task and Unobservability on a message flow. The model has Unobservability but does not define the required Auditability security artifact on equivalent operations.",
  "Summarize Explanation of Conflict": "Auditability task requirements are not present in the model.",
  "Resolution Suggestion": "Add an Auditability security artifact linking specifically from a data object read to corresponding tasks, ensuring analogue process outlining as per pattern."
