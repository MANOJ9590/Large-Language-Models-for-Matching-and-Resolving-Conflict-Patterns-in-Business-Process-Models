 Pattern ID :32
Pattern Name: (Error_D_Unobserv.NonDel) Non-delegation-annotated task sends messages over an Unobservability-annotated messageFlow.bpmnq
To determine if a conflict is detected between the model and the conflict pattern based on the provided XML content, we'll parse and analyze both the conflict pattern and the model as per the specified criteria.

### Parsing the Conflict Pattern:

1. **Conflict Pattern Tasks and Flows:**
   - `Task 1`: `NonDelegation_1` associated with a task `@A`.
   - `MessageFlow 1`: `Unobservability_2` associated with the message flow from `Task_1` to `Participant_2`.

2. **Security Artifacts:**
   - **Non-delegation** associated with `Task_1` (`NonDelegation_1`).
   - **Unobservability** associated with `MessageFlow 1` (`Unobservability_2`).

### Parsing the Model:

1. **Model Tasks and Flows:**
   - **Task:** `Task_11` (`Submit evaluation`). However, no `Non-delegation` associated with it.
   - **MessageFlow:** `MessageFlow_1` (`evaluation` message).

2. **Matching Security Artifacts:**
   - **Non-Delegation**: Does not appear in the model explicitly.
   - **Unobservability**: Associated with `MessageFlow_1` (`Unobservability_2`).

### Conflict Analysis:

**Criteria for Conflict:**

To detect a conflict, the following must be true:
- The model contains all security artifacts from the pattern.
- Artifact names must match.
- Security artifact properties and task/message flow operations (READ/WRITE) must match between the two, with identical operations on a data object.

In this case, the conflict pattern specifies:
- A task annotated with **Non-delegation** (`NonDelegation_1`).
- A message flow annotated with **Unobservability** (`Unobservability_2`).

#### Detected Conflict Details:
- **Model Lacks Non-Delegation**: The model does not specify this security artifact for `Task_1` or any task.
- **Matching Flow with Unobservability**: The `MessageFlow_1` matches with `Unobservability`, satisfying part of the pattern.

#### Conflcit Explanation:
The conflict implies the model attempts to communicate over a message flow requiring unobservability, missing the non-delegation constraint needed to prevent delegation. The model's message flow complies with unobservability but lacks the matched non-delegation setting, failing to ensure the message is sent only by the intended actor without delegation.


### Resolution Suggestion:

To resolve this conflict:
- **Align Non-Delegation Requirements**: Ensure that the task sending the message annotated with unobservability also includes a non-delegation constraint (`NonDelegation_1` type).
- **Artifact Specification**: Explicitly specify the non-delegation property for the necessary task(s) in the process to satisfy complete pattern requirements.

### Summary:

There is a partial conflict detection since the security artifacts in the model align only partially with those in the pattern. Specifically, the non-delegation requirement is missing for the task, causing incomplete security enforcement.

{
    "Conflict Pattern Name": "(Error_D_Unobserv.NonDel) Non-delegation-annotated task sends messages over an Unobservability-annotated messageFlow.bpmnq",
    "conflict Detection": false,
    "Explanation of Conflict": "The conflict pattern specifies a task to be non-delegation enforced when sending through an unobservability message flow. However, the model contains only the unobservability attribute without a corresponding non-delegation artifact.",
    "Summarise Explanation of Conflict": "Missing non-delegation on a task with a matching unobservability flow.",
    "Resolution Suggestion": "Ensure that tasks in the model set for unobservable message flows also have non-delegation constraints, aligning with pattern requirements."
}
```
This detailed analysis suggests focusing on aligning task-level security annotations to comprehensively address the pattern's requirements within the BPMN model.
