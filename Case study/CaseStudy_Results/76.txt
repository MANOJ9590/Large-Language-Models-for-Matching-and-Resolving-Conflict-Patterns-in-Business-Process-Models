 Pattern ID :76
Pattern Name: (Warning_D_Unobserv.NonDel) A (Path) between a Non-delegation-annotated task and a task that sends a message over Unobservability-annotated messageFlow.bpmnq
To assess conflict detection, we need to perform a step-by-step comparison and mapping between the conflict pattern and the model. Let's parse the XML contents and analyze the tasks, message flows, and their respective security artifacts.

### Parsing Conflict Pattern:
- **Tasks (Process 2 - @Y Process):**
  - Task 1: `@A` with `NonDelegation`
  - Task 2: `@B`

- **Message Flows:**
  - MessageFlow_1 connecting Task 2 (`@B`) and Participant 2, with `Unobservability`

- **Security Artifacts:**
  - `NonDelegation_1` related to Task `@A`
  - `Unobservability_2` related to `MessageFlow_1`

### Parsing Model:
- **Tasks (Process 2 - Tele-medicine Device Process):**
  - Task ID: `Task_1` named "Measure vital signs"
  - Task ID: `Task_2` named "Send data to portal"

- **Associations with Artifacts:**
  - `Unobservability_2` related to `MessageFlow_1`
  - Task `Task_1` ("Measure vital signs") has no association with `NonDelegation`
  - Task `Task_2` ("Send data to portal") has `Anonymity`, which differs from `Unobservability`

- **Message Flows:**
  - Autogenerated: `MessageFlow_6` corresponding indirectly to `MessageFlow_1` in the model but without corresponding Unobservability or NonDelegation annotations.

### Conflict Analysis:
- **Pattern vs Model Analysis:**
  - The conflict pattern has `Unobservability` on a message flow connected to Task `@B` and `NonDelegation` on Task `@A`.
  - The model has a `MessageFlow_1` with Unobservability annotations but this is linked to a different security requirement, `Anonymity`, which is not equivalent to `Unobservability`.

### Conflict Detection Criteria:
1. **Matching Security Artifacts:**
   - Security artifacts `Unobservability` in the pattern should match exactly with model’s message association.
   - The association of `NonDelegation` with a task should be verified, but the task in the model lacks a `NonDelegation` association, evidenced through its absence.

2. **Operations Specificity:**
   - Both models should specify identical operations on a data object, which is missing here (`READ` vs `WRITE` conflict detection).

### Conclusion:
**Is a Conflict Detected?**
- **Conflict Detected:** No

**Explanation of Conflict:**
- The absence of exact artifact matches (`Unobservability` and `NonDelegation`) on corresponding tasks or message flows leads to no conflict detected.
- Specifically, there is no `NonDelegation` enforcement on any task within the model ATM or equivalent to Task `@A`.

**Resolution Suggestion:**
- Examine model specifications to enforce a direct `NonDelegation` comparable to the conflict pattern model requirements if desired.
- Ensure `Unobservability` artifacts are consistent in naming and context application across both pattern and model if intending alignment.

    "Summarise Explanation of Conflict": "No match found for NonDelegation during the message flow unobservability process, hence no conflict.",
    "Resolution Suggestion": "Consider aligning task associations with required security artifacts and ensuring shared data objects share symmetric roles (i.e., identical operations on objects)."
