 Pattern ID :10
Pattern Name: (Error_B_Unobserv.NonRep) Unobservability and Non-repudation are required by the same messageFlow.bpmnq
Upon analyzing both the conflict pattern and the provided BPMN model, let's proceed to identify any conflicts based on the given criteria.

### Conflict Detection Analysis:

1. **Conflict Pattern Elements:**
   - **Message Flow (ID: MessageFlow_1)** is associated with:
     - `Non-repudiation` (ID: NonRepudiation_1)
     - `Unobservability` (ID: Unobservability_1)

2. **Model Elements:**
   - **Message Flow (ID: MessageFlow_1)** is associated with:
     - `Non-repudiation` (ID: NonRepudiation_1)
     - `Unobservability` (ID: Unobservability_2)
     - Additional security artifacts like `Confidentiality`, which is not part of the conflict pattern.

### Conflict Detection:

- The conflict pattern specifies that `Unobservability` and `Non-repudiation` are applied to the same `Message Flow`, which is also observed in the provided BPMN model for `Message Flow_1`.
- There are *identical operations* found in both the conflict pattern and the model, specifically regarding `Non-repudiation` and `Unobservability`, and both security artifacts appear in the model.
- **Conflict is detected** because both the `Non-repudiation` and `Unobservability` artifacts are associated with the *same* `Message Flow_1` in the model, matching the conflict pattern.

### Explanation of Conflict:

The conflict arises because associating both `Unobservability` and `Non-repudiation` with the same `Message Flow` inherently creates a contradiction. `Unobservability` addresses the requirement to keep an action unnoticeable, which can often require actions to remain concealed or without accountability markers. In contrast, `Non-repudiation` ensures that an action cannot be denied by its actor, thereby necessitating transparency and record-keeping. These two requirements inherently oppose each other if applied to the same message flow or action.

### Impact on Use Case:

- This conflict implies a fundamental contradiction in the security requirements for `Message Flow_1`. Stakeholders may demand both high accountability (`Non-repudiation`) and complete obfuscation (`Unobservability`) of actions, which cannot be concurrently satisfied.

### Suggested Resolution:

- **Resolution Proposal**: Evaluate the specific needs of `Message Flow_1`. If accountability is a priority, consider de-emphasizing or removing `Unobservability` for this particular flow. Alternatively, if the focus is on concealment and protecting against external observation, reconsider the necessity of `Non-repudiation`. If both must be maintained in some form, split the information or action path where feasible: assign `Non-repudiation` to certain elements while maintaining `Unobservability` elsewhere, hence addressing separate requirements through distinct paths.

### Conclusion:

A conflict, as identified, implies that fulfilling both `Unobservability` and `Non-repudiation` on the same message flow may not be viable without addressing the underlying functional requirements separately or redefining the security strategy.
