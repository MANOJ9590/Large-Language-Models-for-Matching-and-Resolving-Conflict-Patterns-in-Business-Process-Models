 Pattern ID :81
Pattern Name: (Warning_E_Anony.Authent)(2) (Path) between task writes data to Authenticity dataObject and task sends messages over Anonymity(AI) messageFlow.bpmnq
To determine if a conflict is detected, let's break down the conflict pattern and the model, focusing specifically on the tasks, message flows, and their associated security artifacts.

### Conflict Pattern Analysis

1. **Tasks**:
   - Task_1: `@A` (writes to output2 linked as WRITE)
   - Task_2: `@C` (involves in message flow `MessageFlow_1` marked with anonymity)

2. **Security Artifacts**:
   - `Authenticity_1` linked to `DataObject_2` (WRITE operation due to `DataOutputAssociation_1`)
   - `Anonymity_2`: `anonymityLevel="Anonymous"`, `insiderAdversary="true"`, linked to the `MessageFlow_1`

### Model Analysis

1. **Tasks**:
   - Task_1: `Measure vital signs`
   - Task_2: `Send data to portal` (WRITE operation)
   - Message Flow `MessageFlow_6` matching pattern requirements

2. **Security Artifacts**:
   - `Anonymity_3`: `anonymityLevel="Anonymous"`, `insiderAdversary="true"`, linked to `Task_2`
   - None of the artifacts match exactly like `Authenticity_1` that is WRITE on `DataObject_2`

### Conflict Detection:

1. **Anonymity Conflict**:
   - `MessageFlow_6` matches the pattern's criteria with `Anonymity_3` which matches pattern (`anonymityLevel="Anonymous"`, `insiderAdversary="true"`). However, it’s linked to `Task_2`.

2. **Authenticity Write Operation**:
   - The pattern expects `DataObject_2` to be protected by `Authenticity`. However, the model does not have security artifacts defined exactly as in the pattern to write an `Authencity type`. The model uses `Accountability_1` and other artifacts not matching `Authenticity`.

### Conflict Determination:

Given the analysis, there is **no conflict** based on the criteria because:

- **No Complete Match of Security Artifacts**: Although there’s a match with `Anonymity`, the pattern's specific requirement `Authenticity with WRITE` is not replicably found in the model. This breaks one of the required conditions for a conflict.

Therefore, based on the criteria set, there is no conflict detected. The model does have similar transparency requirements, but without a conflict detection trigger with the provided pattern.

### Resolution Suggestion:
Since no conflict was detected, no resolution is needed. However, for future clarity and requirements coverage in models:

- **Ensure Security Artifact Coverage**: If the task or message flow requires certain intra-activity assurances, make sure the BPMN model incorporates the exact security artifact types and operations as required.

- **Document Security Transactions**: Clearly document the type of operations allowed on data objects with corresponding security artifacts for traceability and conflict detection.
