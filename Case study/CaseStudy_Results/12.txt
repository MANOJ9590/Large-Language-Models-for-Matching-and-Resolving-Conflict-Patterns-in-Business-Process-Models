 Pattern ID :12
Pattern Name: (Error_C_Anony.Audit)(2) Anonymity(anonymous, insider)-annotated task reads data from an Auditability-annotated dataObject.bpmnq
To detect conflicts based on the criteria provided, we need to carefully parse both the conflict pattern and the model, examining the security artifacts and operations associated with tasks and message flows. Let's conduct this analysis.

### Conflict Pattern Analysis:

1. **Task in Pattern:**
   - **Task ID:** `Task_3`
   - **Data Input Association:** Connected with `DataObject_2`, operation is 'READ'.

2. **Security Artifacts in Pattern:**
   - **Anonymity:**
     - **Properties:** `anonymityLevel="Anonymous"`, `insiderAdversary="true"`.
     - Associated with `Task_3`.
   - **Auditability:**
     - Assumes frequency, associated with `DataObject_2`.

### Model Analysis:

1. **Task in Model:**
   - **Task ID:** `Task_2`
   - **Data Input & Output Association:**
     - `DataOutput_9` and `DataOutput_10` without a direct 'READ' link from any Auditability data object, indicates no conflict through direct
     - **Security Artifact:**
       - **Anonymity:** ID `Anonymity_3`, `anonymityLevel="Anonymous"`, `insiderAdversary="true"`.

2. **Security Artifacts in Model:**
   - No direct **Auditability** artifact with 'READ' operation detected on a data object linked to a task with Anonymity properties as described in the conflict pattern.

### Conflict Detection:

- **Matching Criteria:**
  - The pattern specifies that an Anonymity task is reading from an Auditable data object, fulfilling specific anonymity properties.
  - The model includes Anonymity with identical anonymity properties on `Task_2`, but lacks a **READ** operation on an **Auditability**-annotated data object, thus making direct conflict detection not valid.

### Analysis Conclusion:

- **Conflict Detected:** No
- **Explanation:**
  - The conflict criteria are not met because there are no Anonymity-protected tasks reading from an Auditability-annotated data object mirroring those properties as in the pattern.
  - The security association does not mirror the exact operations required to declare a conflict – ensuring both 'READ' operations on data objects with matching properties.

### Suggestion:

- **Resolution Suggestion:** There is no conflict to resolve, as the model correctly avoids the erroneous condition of combining Anonymity and Auditability in a 'READ' context.

```json
{
    "Conflict Pattern Name": "(Error_C_Anony.Audit)(2) Anonymity(anonymous, insider)-annotated task reads data from an Auditability-annotated dataObject.bpmnq",
    "Conflict Detection": false,
    "Explanation of Conflict": "The conflict pattern requires an Anonymity-annotated task to perform a 'READ' from an Auditability-annotated data object. In the model provided, there is no such operation, thus no conflict.",
    "Summarise Explanation of Conflict": "No conflicting 'READ' operations from Auditability data objects found with Anonymity annotation.",
    "Resolution Suggestion": "No action needed as the model does not violate the conflict pattern."
}
```

In essence, the model is devoid of the described conflict under the given pattern criteria, and no corrective measures are necessary.
