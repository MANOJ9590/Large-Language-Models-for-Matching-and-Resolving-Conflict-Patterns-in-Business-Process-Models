 Pattern ID :89
Pattern Name: (Warning_E_Unobserv.NonRep)(2) (Path) between task writes data to Nonrep dataObject and task that sends messages over Unobservability messageFlow.bpmnq
To determine if a conflict exists within the provided BPMN models, we must compare the specific use case model against the conflict pattern using the predefined criteria.

### Parsing and Analyzing the XML Content:

1. **Conflict Pattern:**
   - **Tasks:**
     - Task_1 ("@A") writes to DataObject_2 ("@B") with Non-repudiation associated.
     - Task_2 ("@C") is involved in a message flow with Unobservability.
   - **Associations:**
     - "DataObject_2" with Non-repudiation_1.
     - "MessageFlow_1" with Unobservability_1.

2. **Model:**
   - **Tasks:**
     - Task_2 ("Send data to portal") participates in a message flow identified as MessageFlow_6.
     - Task_11 ("Submit evaluation") and associated data object with Non-repudiation (NonRepudiation_3).
   - **Associations:**
     - "MessageFlow_1" associated with Non-repudiation and Unobservability.
     - DataObject "Evaluation Form" is linked with Non-repudiation.

### Conflict Detection:

1. **Match in Task Operations and Security Artifacts:**
   - Both models involve Non-repudiation :
     - **Pattern:** DataObject_2 has Non-repudiation.
     - **Model:** DataObject_7 ("Evaluation Form") has Non-repudiation.
   - Both models involve a MessageFlow with Unobservability:
     - **Pattern:** MessageFlow_1 with Unobservability.
     - **Model:** MessageFlow_1 has Unobservability (Unobservability_2).
   - Both tasks in the model and the pattern are performing WRITE operations on their respective data objects.

2. **Conflict Analysis:**
   - **Conflict Detected:** The conflict pattern and the model both contain tasks/message flows with identical security annotations (Non-repudiation for a task writing to a data object and Unobservability for a message flow) linked to similar operations, which indicates a conflict.
   - **Meaning of Conflict:** This conflict indicates that there is a contradiction or overlap in ensuring both Non-repudiation and Unobservability for the same set of information or communication processes. While Non-repudiation asserts record and validation of actions by users, Unobservability ensures those actions remain undetectable. These can be inherently conflicting when linked to the same operations without additional context or control structures to resolve duality in security objectives.

3. **Resolution Suggestion:**
   - Evaluate the process to ensure clarity in when and why Non-repudiation and Unobservability should be applied. If both are necessary, consider:
     - Segregating operations or message flows that should remain unobserved from those requiring non-repudiation.
     - Employing conditional controls that apply one property at a time based on context, purpose, or phase of transaction.
     - Introducing transparent logging mechanisms or participant confirmations under secure conditions to harmonize objectives.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "Conflict Pattern Name": "Warning_E_Unobserv.NonRep(2) (Path) between task writes data to Nonrep dataObject and task that sends messages over Unobservability messageFlow.bpmnq",
    "Conflict Detection": true,
    "Explanation of Conflict": "The conflict pattern and the model both involve tasks with Non-repudiation on written data objects and message flows with Unobservability, leading to a contradiction in simultaneity in validity checks and obscuration of operational visibility in the same context.",
    "Summarise Explanation of Conflict": "Simultaneous application of Non-repudiation and Unobservability creates an inherent conflict in security objectives.",
    "Resolution Suggestion": "Segregate operations needing Non-repudiation from those requiring Unobservability or use context-driven controllable switch between these properties."
