 Pattern ID :35
Pattern Name: (Error_E_Anony.Audit)(2) A task writes data to an Auditiability-annotated dataObject and sends messages over an Anonymity(AI)-annotated messageFlow.bpmnq
To determine if there is a conflict between the provided BPMN model and the conflict pattern, we need to analyze both based on the number of criteria specified. Let's break it down:

1. **Conflict Pattern Analysis:**
   - **Security Requirement:** The Conflict Pattern describes a scenario where a task writes data to a data object that has been annotated with Auditability and then sends messages via a message flow annotated with Anonymity. 
   - **Example Objects:**
     - Task: `Task_1` writes to `DataObject_2`, which is annotated with Auditability.
     - Message Flow: `MessageFlow_1` is annotated with Anonymity.

2. **Model Analysis:**
   - **Security Artifacts and Associations:**
     - There are a number of tasks and message flows within the model, each associated with various security requirements.
     - We need to identify if any task writes data to an Auditiablility-annotated data object and utilizes a message flow with Anonymity.

3. **Comparison and Conflict Detection:**
   - **Model Task Analysis:** Look for a task that writes a data object with Auditiability, but no task does this in the model.
   - **Model Message Flow Analysis:** Check message flows for Anonymity annotation. `MessageFlow_6` is linked to `Task_2` with Anonymity (Anonymity_3 association), but the task writes output to a different entity, `DataObject_7`, which isn't annotated with Auditability.

The critical condition for conflict detection is:
- Both elements in the pattern (Auditability on data object associated with a task and anonymity on a message flow linked to the same task) must match fully in the model.

**Conclusion:**
- **Conflicts Detected:** No conflict detected because, although two elements are individually present, they do not collectively match the conflict pattern as both conditions have not been met in the model simultaneously.

**Suggested Resolution:**
- No active conflict implies no immediate resolution is required. However, ensure that future model changes should continuously match stringent security requirements and check before executing changes.
