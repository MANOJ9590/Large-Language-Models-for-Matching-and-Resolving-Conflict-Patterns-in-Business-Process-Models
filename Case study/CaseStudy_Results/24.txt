 Pattern ID :24
Pattern Name: (Error_D_Anony.Audit)(2) Auditiability-annotated task sends messages over an Anonymity(Anonymous,Insider)-annotated messageFlow.bpmnq
To determine whether a conflict is detected, we need to analyze and extract relevant information from both the conflict pattern and the model. Let's go through the criteria for conflict detection step-by-step:

### Parsing and Extracting Information

1. **Conflict Pattern Analysis:**
   - **Task in Conflict Pattern**: `Task_1` with an associated security artifact of `auditability`.
   - **Message Flow in Conflict Pattern**: `MessageFlow_1` with associated security artifact of `anonymity` having properties `anonymityLevel="Anonymous"` and `insiderAdversary="true"`.

2. **Model Analysis:**
   - **Tasks in the Model**: `Task_11` named "Submit evaluation" is associated with `nonrepudiation`, and `Task_2` named "Send data to portal" is associated with `accountability`.
   - **Message Flows in the Model**: `MessageFlow_1` with associated security artifacts of `nonrepudiation`, `unobservability`, and `confidentiality`.

### Conflict Detection Criteria

1. **Security Artifact Match:**
   - The conflict pattern specifies `auditability` for a task and `anonymity` for a message flow with specific properties.
   - In the model, `Task_2` contains a different type, `accountability`, not matching with `auditability`.
   - `MessageFlow_1` in the model is linked to `nonrepudiation`, `unobservability`, and `confidentiality`, lacking the `anonymity` specification as per the conflict pattern.

2. **Identical Operations on Data Objects:**
   - The conflict pattern outlines a structure that checks for identical operations ('READ' or 'WRITE') on a data object.
   - There is no clear operation match in the model for `Task_2` or `MessageFlow_1`, as they differ in security artifacts and associated properties.

3. **Matching of Type and Properties:**
   - For a conflict, both models need identical security artifact types and properties, which are missing in this case.

4. **Unmatching Security Artifacts:**
   - The model lacks a complete match of the `anonymity` security artifact with the correct properties outlined in the conflict pattern.

### Analysis and Conclusion

- **Conflict Detection**: No conflict is detected. The model's security artifacts do not match the conflict pattern in both type and defined properties.
- **Explanation**: The model does not replicate the same security requirements as the conflict pattern. Particularly, the task's `accountability` and message flow's security artifacts like `unobservability` and `confidentiality` differ, lacking a representation of both `auditability` and full `anonymity`.
- **Resolution Suggestion**: None needed since no conflict is presently detected. If `auditability` is desired on tasks and `anonymity` on message flows, update the model's security artifacts accordingly to establish consistency as intended by the conflict pattern.
