 Pattern ID :69
Pattern Name: (Warning_D_Anony.NonDel) A (Path) between a Non-delegation task and a task that sends a message over an Anonymity(AI) messageFlow.bpmnq
### Conflict Detection Analysis

#### Parsing and Extraction

1. **Conflict Pattern Parsing:**
   - **Tasks:**
     - Task_1 (Name: @A)
     - Task_2 (Name: @B)

   - **Message Flow:**
     - ID: MessageFlow_1, SourceRef: Task_2, TargetRef: Participant_2

   - **Security Artifacts:**
     - Anonymity_1 with properties anonymityLevel="Anonymous" and insiderAdversary="true" associated with MessageFlow_1
     - NonDelegation_1 associated with Task_1

2. **Model Parsing:**
   - **Tasks:**
     - Task_1 (Name: Measure vital signs)
     - Task_2 (Name: Send data to portal)

   - **Message Flow:**
     - MessageFlow_6: SourceRef: Task_2, TargetRef: StartEvent_5
     - MessageFlow_1: SourceRef: Task_11, TargetRef: IntermediateCatchEvent_2

   - **Security Artifacts:**
     - Anonymity_3 with properties anonymityLevel="Anonymous" and insiderAdversary="true" associated with Task_2
     - NonRepudiation_2 associated with DataObjectReference_2
     - NonRepudiation_1 associated with MessageFlow_1
     - Multiple others, none match the exact combination needed for conflict.

#### Conflict Detection Criteria

- **Anonymity and Non-Delegation Matching:**
  - No task in the model is specifically annotated with Non-Delegation. Hence, there's no direct match for NonDelegation_1 of the conflict pattern.
  - The conflict pattern's requirement for a path between a Non-delegation and anonymity (MessageFlow_1) is not satisfied as there is no Non-delegation artifact annotated to any task corresponding to Task_1 or Task_2 in the model.

- **Message Flows:**
  - The message flow related to anonymity (MessageFlow_6) does not match both anonymity and non-delegation as the conflict pattern requires.

#### Conclusion
- **Conflict Detected:** False
- **Explanation:** The task annotated with Non-delegation in the conflict pattern does not find a corresponding task with the same security annotation in the model. Additionally, the combination of message flows and their security settings does not replicate the scenario necessary to claim a conflict, as defined by the pattern. The model misses the non-delegation constraint on the path required by the conflict pattern.

- **Resolution Suggestion:** No specific action is needed since there was no conflict detected. Ensure that future processes are checked for the matching security artifact types and properties, especially when combining security details across tasks and message flows to avoid potential conflicts.
