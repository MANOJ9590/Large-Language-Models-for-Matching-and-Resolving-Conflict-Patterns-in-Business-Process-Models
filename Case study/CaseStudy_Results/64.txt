 Pattern ID :64
Pattern Name: (Warning_C_Unobserv.NonRep)(Path) between a task sends messages via Nonrep messageFlow and task sends messages via a Unobservability messageFlow.bpmnq
To determine if there is a conflict detected based on the criteria provided, let's analyze the XML contents of both the conflict pattern and the model.

### Conflict Pattern Analysis

1. **Conflict Pattern Name**: Warning_C_Unobserv.NonRep)(Path) between a task sends messages via Nonrep messageFlow and task sends messages via a Unobservability messageFlow.
2. **Core Security Artifacts in Conflict Pattern**:
   - **MessageFlow_1** associated with **Unobservability_1**.
   - **MessageFlow_2** associated with **NonRepudiation_1**.

3. **Messages**:
   - A message from **Task_1** (sourceRef) to **Participant_2** (targetRef) via **MessageFlow_1**.
   - A message from **Task_2** (sourceRef) to **Participant_2** (targetRef) via **MessageFlow_2**.

### Model Analysis

1. **Core Security Artifacts in Model**:
   - **MessageFlow_1** in the model is associated with both **Unobservability_2** and **NonRepudiation_1**.
   - **MessageFlow_6** is associated with different artifacts (**Undetectability_2**, **Confidentiality_3**, etc.).

2. **Messages**:
   - A message from **Task_11** (sourceRef) to **IntermediateCatchEvent_2** (targetRef) via **MessageFlow_1**.
   - A message from **Task_2** (sourceRef) to **StartEvent_5** via **MessageFlow_6**.

### Conflict Detection

Based on the analysis of the pattern and model:

- **Security Artifact Match**:
   - **NonRepudiation_1** in the pattern matches with an association in the model's **MessageFlow_1**.
   - **Unobservability_1** in the pattern also matches with the model's **Unobservability_2** on **MessageFlow_1**.

- **Requirements Match**:
   - Both the pattern and model require **NonRepudiation** and **Unobservability** on the same message flow, which fulfills all required matches specified in the pattern.

- **Operation Conflicts**:
   - No data operation conflict is detected because the conflict pattern is primarily concerned with message flows rather than read/write operations on data objects.

### Conclusion

- **Conflict Detection**: True.
- **Explanation**: A conflict arises when both **NonRepudiation** and **Unobservability** are applied to the same message flow. These security goals are inherently contradictory as non-repudiation requires traceability, whereas unobservability emphasizes hidden actions.
- **Requirement Conflict**: In this context, the requirement that actions must not be denied (non-repudiation) is in direct conflict with the requirement that the interaction be invisible (unobservability).
- **Resolution Suggestion**: 
  - Review the business requirement or processes involved to determine which security requirement is paramount. 
  - Alternatively, separate the message flows if distinct non-repudiation or unobservability properties are needed for different parts of the process, or apply these properties to different communication paths or different layers of the system.

### Summary

There is a detected conflict where a nonrepudiation requirement is incompatible with an unobservability requirement on the same message flow within the BPMN model.

```json
{
    "Conflict Pattern Name": "Warning_C_Unobserv.NonRep)(Path) between a task sends messages via Nonrep messageFlow and task sends messages via a Unobservability messageFlow.bpmnq",
    "conflcit Detection": true,
    "Explanation of Conflict": "A conflict arises when both NonRepudiation and Unobservability are applied to the same message flow, as these goals are contradictory.",
    "Summarise Explanation of Conflict": "NonRepudiation requires traceability while Unobservability requires invisibility, creating a conflict.",
    "Resolution Suggestion": "Determine which security requirement is paramount or separate message flows for distinct application of these properties."
}
```

This conflict is rooted in tension between ensuring actions cannot be denied, versus making them undetectable, demonstrating an effective contrast between visibility and invisibility requirements.
