### Conflict Detection Analysis:

1. **Tasks and Path Identification:**
   - **Conflict Pattern:** 
       - Task "Task_1" named "@A"
       - Task "Task_2" named "@B"
       - A path exists between "@A" and "@B" via "Path_1".
   - **Model:** 
       - Task "Task_1" named "Complete Recovery Questionnaire"
       - Task "Task_2" named "Submit Questionnaire to portal"
       - A path exists with sequence flows "SequenceFlow_4", "SequenceFlow_6", etc., connecting these tasks indirectly through intermediate tasks.

2. **Security Artifacts Comparison:**
   - **Conflict Pattern:** 
       - Non-repudiation associated with "MessageFlow_2"
       - Unobservability associated with "MessageFlow_1"
   - **Model:** 
       - Anonymity artifacts associated with both "MessageFlow_1" and "MessageFlow_2" but with different properties (anonymityLevel, insiderAdversary).
   
3. **Conflict Criteria:**
   - In the conflict pattern, "Non-repudiation" and "Unobservability" security artifacts are specified, while the model contains "Anonymity" artifacts.
   - The properties and types of security artifacts do not match between the conflict pattern and the model. Therefore, no exact match in security artifacts signals no conflict.

4. **Requirement and Explanation for Conflict:**
   - The conflict would only arise if exactly matching security artifacts are used in both the conflict pattern and the model. Since they differ, particularly in the security property type and details, there is no conflict based on the mismatch of the required security conformance.

### Resolution Suggestion:
- **As no conflict is detected under the current comparison and criteria,** no immediate resolution is necessary.
- However, to prevent potential issues related to security property mismatches, the model's security requirements could be reviewed and adjusted to align explicitly with any organizational or use-case-specific security policies and compliance needs.
- Verification can be extended for proper configuration of anonymity so that properties align with stakeholders’ expectations for security measures applicable to message flows and tasks.

### Consistency in Analysis:
- This analysis was conducted with strict adherence to the outlined criteria, focusing on the exact match of security artifacts, properties, and operations across comparable models and pattern applications.
