Pattern Name : (Error_E_Unobserv.Authent)(2)task writes to Authenticity-annotated dataObject and sends messages over Unobservability-annotated messageFlow.bpmnq
To determine if there is a conflict detected between the provided BPMN model and the conflict pattern, we will go through the required steps:

1. **Parse and Extract Elements:**
   - **Conflict Pattern Elements:**
     - Task: Task_1 outputs to DataObject_2.
     - Message Flow: MessageFlow_1.
     - Security Artifacts: 
       - Unobservability linked to MessageFlow_1.
       - Authenticity linked to DataObject_2.

   - **Model Elements:**
     - Task: Task_11 tasks outputs data to Task_11.
     - Message Flow: MessageFlow_1 is associated with a message between Task_11 and IntermediateCatchEvent_2.
     - Security Artifacts:
       - Attribute: Unobservability linked to MessageFlow_1.
       - Attribute: Nonrepudiation linked to MessageFlow_1.
       - Attribute: Confidentiality linked to MessageFlow_1.
       - Authenticity on DataObject_3 "EHR".

2. **Conflict Detection Analysis:**
   - **Security Artifacts Matching:**
     - The Conflict Pattern requires:
       - Unobservability on Message Flow.
       - Authenticity on DataObject.
     - The Model provides:
       - Unobservability on MessageFlow_1: Matches with the conflict pattern.
       - Authenticity on EHR: There is a data output association from a task to EHR.

   - **Operation Consistency:**
     - **Conflict Pattern:** writes to Authenticity-annotated dataObject and sends message over Unobservability-annotated messageFlow.
     - **Model:** 
       - MessageFlow_1 is Unobservability protected but involved in other protections like Nonrepudiation and Confidentiality as well which are not part of the conflict pattern.
       - DataObject "Evaluation" has Nonrepudiation protection from Task_11, where the operation involves writing to it.

The primary issue here is the authenticity requires for the specific data object "Evaluation" in the model, which parallels the authenticity requirement in the conflict pattern but diverges on the operation nature (here it doesn’t purely refer to the authenticity artifact but another security notion – non-repudiation). It doesn’t satisfy exactness in operation nor perfectly matches types required by the pattern.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - There is **NO CONFLICT** detected because although Unobservability aligns perfectly, authenticity seemed to touch on a different artifact type in the model in essence of an operation and specific coverage mandated by the conflict pattern; while it wasn’t levering on one identical artifact as defined purely by the authentic operation involved, mismatches the security requirements described academically between operations on the data.

**Resolution Suggestion (if conflict was present):**
- Ensure focus on encapsulating the right security context; definitively check if the authenticity indeed overlays exclusivity against operations while strictly ensuring artifacts and associative links are pristine and distinct in compliance with their expected properties. Therefore, resolving involves re-examining all tasked data states and outputs to envelop full authenticity controls in bespoke security interactions.
