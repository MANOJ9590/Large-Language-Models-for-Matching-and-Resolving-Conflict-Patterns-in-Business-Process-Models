Pattern Name : (Warning_E_Unobserv.Audit)(2)(Path) between task writes data to Auditiability dataObject and task sends messages over Unobservability messageFlow.bpmnq
Upon analyzing both the conflict pattern and the model provided, I have identified the tasks, message flows, and security artifacts, as well as their associations within both the BPMN conflict pattern and the use case model.

### Key elements in the Conflict Pattern:

- **Tasks:**
  - Task 1 (`@A`)
  - Task 2 (`@C`)

- **Message Flows and Associations:**
  - MessageFlow 1 between Task 2 (`@C`) and Participant 2.

- **Security Artifacts:**
  - Unobservability:
    - Applied to `MessageFlow_1`

- **Associations:**
  - Auditability:
    - Associated with DataObject_2 (`@B`), written by Task 1 (`@A`).

### Key elements in the Model:

- **Tasks:**
  - Task 1 (`Measure vital signs`)
  - Task 2 (`Send data to portal`)

- **Message Flows and Associations:**
  - MessageFlow 1 connected to data message `evaluation`.

- **Security Artifacts:**
  - Unobservability:
    - Applied to `MessageFlow_1`.
  - Non-repudiation:
    - Applied to `MessageFlow_1`.

### Conflict Check:

- **Matching Security Artifacts:**
  - The conflict pattern specifies Unobservability associated with Message Flow, and the model also specifies Unobservability in the same manner for `MessageFlow_1`. This indicates one part of the pattern matches the model.

- **Operations Conflict:**
  - Conflict pattern specifies a write operation on a data object for an Auditability artifact. The model does not have an `Auditability` artifact specifically tied in a manner matching the conflict pattern requirements.

- **Security Artifact Match:**
  - The model has additional security artifacts such as Non-repudiation not present in the conflict pattern.

### Conclusion:

- **Conflict Detection:**
  - There is no conflict detected. The secure association between tasks and security artifacts concerning operations on a data object does not fully match the specified pattern due to the absence of matching auditability associations in the model.

### Resolution Suggestion:
Since no conflict was detected, there are no specific resolutions required for this scenario. If a conflict was meant to be detected, one might need to recheck the matching rules or redefine associations.

    "Conflict Pattern Name": "(Warning_E_Unobserv.Audit)(2)(Path) between task writes data to Auditiability dataObject and task sends messages over Unobservability messageFlow.bpmnq",
    "conflcit Detection": false,
    "Explanation of Conflict": "No conflict is detected as the model does not completely match the security artifact associations in the conflict pattern, particularly lacking the necessary auditability relationships.",
    "Summarise Explanation of Conflict": "No matching conflict as auditability associations do not align between models and pattern.",
    "Resolution Suggestion": "No conflict detected. Therefore, no resolution is needed."
