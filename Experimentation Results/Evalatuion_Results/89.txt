Pattern Name : (Warning_E_Unobserv.NonRep)(2) (Path) between task writes data to Nonrep dataObject and task that sends messages over Unobservability messageFlow.bpmnq
To determine whether a conflict exists, we need to evaluate the specific tasks, message flows, and security artifacts in both the conflict pattern and the model provided. Let's break down the process step by step:

### 1. Parsing and Identifying Components:

- **Conflict Pattern:**
  - **Tasks:**
    - `Task_1` with a `dataOutput` associated to `DataObject_2` carrying `Non-repudiation`.
    - `Task_2` is sending over a message flow annotated with `Unobservability`.

  - **Message Flow:**
    - `MessageFlow_1` is secured with `Unobservability` associated via `SecurityAssociation_2`.

- **Model:**
  - **Tasks:**
    - `Task_11` outputs to `DataObject_7` with `Non-repudiation`.
    - `Task_6` outputs to `DataObjectReference_2` with `Non-repudiation`.

  - **Message Flow:**
    - `MessageFlow_1` secured with both `Non-repudiation` and `Unobservability`.

### 2. Conflict Detection:

- The conflict pattern seeks a condition where:
  - A task writes (**Not Just reads**) to a data object under a security artifact (`Non-repudiation`).
  - A subsequent task sends a message over a flow secured by `Unobservability`.

- In the **Model**:
  - **Task**: The model has a task (`Task_11`) outputting data (`DataOutput_7`) with `Non-repudiation`.
  - **Message Flow**: The flow `MessageFlow_1` is associated with both `Non-repudiation` and `Unobservability`, matching the pattern's requirement for `Unobservability`.

### 3. Comparison and Validation:

- **Task Matching**:
  - In the conflict pattern, the task writes (`WRITE operation`) data with `Non-repudiation`.
  - In the model, `DataObject_7` is written (associated) via `DataOutputAssociation_5` during `Write Operation`.

- **Security Artifact Analysis**:
  - **Non-repudiation**: Present in both conflict pattern and model on data objects.
  - **Unobservability**: Present in both conflict pattern and model on message flows.

### Conclusion:

- **Conflict Exists**: Both conditions of the conflict pattern exist in the model, where a task and flows entail the same security specifications without name discrepancies.
- **Explanation of Conflict**: The detected conflict represents a case where a task that ensures `Non-repudiation` on its data output also sends messages over a flow ensuring `Unobservability`. Essentially, the use case conflicts because `Unobservability` restricts the ability to retrospectively trace or prove that an interaction (supported by `Non-repudiation`) took place.
- **Resolution Suggestion**: In scenarios demanding both `Unobservability` and `Non-repudiation`, ensure clear segregation between tasks demanding `Non-repudiation` and those interacting over `Unobservable` pathways. Implement intermediary protocols that log message flows while preserving data integrity.

{
    "Conflict Pattern Name": "(Warning_E_Unobserv.NonRep)(2) (Path) between task writes data to Nonrep dataObject and task that sends messages over Unobservability messageFlow.bpmnq",
    "Conflict Detection": true,
    "Explanation of Conflict": "The conflict emerges due to simultaneous enforcement of 'Non-repudiation' on a data object while using an 'Unobservable' message flow. This creates a contradictory state where actions are supposed to be both traceable (Non-repudiation) and hidden (Unobservable), causing a compliance clash.",
    "Summarise Explanation of Conflict": "Mismatch in security properties where tasks demand opposing verification and anonymity states, conflicting with the operational directives.",
    "Resolution Suggestion": "Implement clear demarcation of security responsibilities; redesign message flows to ensure boundary layers limit potential security conflicts or implement logging mechanisms that satisfy secondary compliance without disrupting primary secure directives."
