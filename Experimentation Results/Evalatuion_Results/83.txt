Pattern Name : (Warning_E_Anony.NonRep)(2)(Path) between task writes data to Nonrep dataObject and task sends messages over Anonymity(AI) messageFlow.bpmnq
To determine if a conflict is detected between the provided Model and the Conflict Pattern, let's analyze both XML contents:

### Conflict Pattern Analysis
- **Tasks**: 
  - Task 1 (id: Task_1) writes to dataObject DataObject_2 with Non-repudiation.
  - Task 2 (id: Task_2) sends a message over MessageFlow_1 which has an Anonymity artifact.

- **Security Artifacts**:
  - Non-repudiation is associated with the data object DataObject_2.
  - Anonymity (anonymous level, insider adversary) is associated with MessageFlow_1.

- **Associations**: 
  - Task 1 has a Non-repudiation requirement to write to DataObject_2.
  - MessageFlow_1 has an Anonymity requirement coming from Task 2 sending messages.

### Model Analysis
- **Tasks**:
  - Task 2 (name: Send data to portal) sends messages over MessageFlow_6.
  - DataObject_8 is linked via Non-repudiation (NonRepudiation_2) to DataObjectReference_2. 

- **Security Artifacts**:
  - Non-repudiation is associated with Task 11 (Submit evaluation) on data object Evaluation.
  - Anonymity (anonymous level, insider adversary) is associated with Task 2 (Send data to portal) via MessageFlow_6.

- **Associations**:
  - MessageFlow_6 is linked with Anonymity.
  - Non-repudiation associated with DataObject_8/Evaluation.

### Conflict Detection
- **Task Security Artifacts Match**:
  The pattern requires Non-repudiation on a data object write operation and Anonymity on a message flow. In the model, Non-repudiation is linked with DataObjectReference_2 and Evaluation, and Anonymity with MessageFlow_6 on "Send data to portal".

- **Task Names**:
  Task names are not used for conflict detection, but their artifacts match if their requirements are identical.

- **Read/Write Analysis**:
  The Conflict Pattern describes a 'WRITE' operation associated with Non-repudiation, whereas both the MessageFlow and Task 2 handling Anonymity in the Model show a 'WRITE' operation. Both 'WRITE' operations match.

- **Security Artifacts Names**:
  In the model, Non-repudiation for data object 'Evaluation' matches the type and nature (Non-repudiation requirement). The Anonymity requirement matches, operating on MessageFlow_6.

### Conclusion
A conflict is **detected** as the pattern of Non-repudiation (WRITE) and Anonymity (message transfer) is present, matching both type and properties.

### Conflict Explanation
The conflict arises from the fact that the requirement to guarantee Non-repudiation on a data object is contradictory to sending messages over an anonymity-guaranteed channel. It implies ensuring actions cannot be denied (Non-repudiation) yet concealing identities (Anonymity) creates a security and operational inconsistency.

### Resolution Suggestion
Re-evaluate the necessity of both security requirements on the same operation. Either:
- Remove Non-repudiation from the message action over anonymity, as concealing sender identity fundamentally contradicts proving action accountability.
- Alternatively, if accountability is paramount, do not use anonymizing methods on message Flow operations that must be non-repudiative.

    "Conflict Pattern Name": "Warning_E_Anony.NonRep)(2)(Path) between task writes data to Nonrep dataObject and task sends messages over Anonymity(AI) messageFlow.bpmnq",
    "conflcit Detection": true,
    "Explanation of Conflict": "The conflict arises because the task writing to a data object with a Non-repudiation requirement also sends messages over an anonymous channel, conflicting the need for identity concealment with operations' undeniable accountability.",
    "Summarise Explanation of Conflic": "Non-repudiation operation contradicts the anonymity requirement simultaneously existing on the message flow.",
    "Resolution Suggestion": "Consider revising one of the security constraints: either remove anonymity or non-repudiation from their conflicting applications to avoid security protocol inconsistencies."
